# Python - 4 - DAD

To [access each value](https://stackoverflow.com/a/26660785) of the array of key-value pairs `kwargs`, I can loop through the `dict`ionary with the keys as follows:

```python
	for k in kwargs:
        print(k, kwargs[k])
```

To [calculate the median](https://www.mathsisfun.com/median.html) of a series of numbers, you have to find either the number which is in the middle of the sorted series if the series is odd or the mean of the two numbers located in the middle if the series is even.
