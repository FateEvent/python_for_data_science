### Exercise 08: Loading

The `tqdm` function is what's called a [generator](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generators-in-python) function, a function that acts as an iterable since it returns a generator object that is iterable, i.e. can be used as an Iterator.
Instead of the `return` statement, a generator function uses the [`yield`](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-yield-keyword) keyword. Similar to a `return` statement that terminates the execution of the function, the `yield` statement only pauses the execution of the function.
