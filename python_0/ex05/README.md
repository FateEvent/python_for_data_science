For this project I use the [sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html) library for receiving the arguments given to the program.

The goal of this project is to create a program that parses the text given as an argument or prompted by the user and displays the count of its upper-case and lower-case characters, punctuation marks, digits and spaces.
